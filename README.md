# Flask Application Setup Guide

Welcome to our Flask application! This guide will help you set up your development environment and run the application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**


2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional):**

It's a good practice to create a virtual environment for your project to isolate dependencies. To create a virtual environment, run the following command:


Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:

  ```
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- On macOS and Linux:

  ```
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

Install the required Python packages using pip:


4. **Configure Environment Variables (if needed):**

If your application uses environment variables (e.g., for database connection), create a `.env` file and define your variables. For example:


5. **Database Setup (if applicable):**

If your application uses a database, set up the database and run migrations if necessary. For example:


6. **Run the Application:**

Run the Flask development server:


Your Flask application should now be running. Access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

Your Flask application is ready to use! You can start building, testing, and modifying the application as needed. Refer to the project's documentation and codebase for specific details on how to use and develop the application.

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your application for production, refer to Flask's deployment documentation for guidance on deploying Flask applications to various hosting platforms.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during setup or while using the application, please refer to our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/your-username/your-flask-app/issues) to see if your problem has already been reported or to report a new issue.
