My loan is 18394 and yet it shows here clearly it's 17994. My question is, is this how people who have defaulted are addressed? Because surely I've started paying.

I had borrowed Sh.25,000 in December 2015 of which I was slightly late in paying but I paid the whole loan today only to be disappointed when I apply for another.
